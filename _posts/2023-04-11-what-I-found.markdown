title: What I found
---

While conducting a survey for my class assignment, I was intrigued by a question about whether 10x programmers exist. So I went on to search for what people think about the question. Where I encountered an interesting blog post: <br>
[The 10x Programmer Myth](https://www.simplethread.com/the-10x-programmer-myth/#:~:text=The%20post%20struck%20a%20chord,programmer%20is%20a%20silly%20myth.%E2%80%9D) <br>
After reading this post, it makes sense for me to hear 10x programmers might exist but not in the way we thought. I think one way to create a 10x or even 10,000x or more programmer is to make AI do it, which would probably make many programmers lose their jobs. <br>
What interests me the most is what the author of the article described as "the types of engineers that make up the mythical 10x software engineer". Even though I have very limited experience working with other software engineers, I do agree that those types of software engineers would be very productive. <br>
I think I fit well in the categories of *The Focusor*, *The Rocket Turtle*, *The Obsessor*, and *The Interrogator*, or at least they are what I am aiming to be. In sum, I think all of them would be great Skills for me to build and improve on.
