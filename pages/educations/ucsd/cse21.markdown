### Description

This course covers mathematical concepts used to model and analyze algorithms and computer systems. Topics include counting techniques (inclusion-exclusion; recursive counting; permutations and combinations), data representations, analysis of algorithms (order notation; time complexities; loop invariants), recurrence relations, graphs and trees (data structure representations; basic graph algorithms; special classes of graphs), and basic probability and its applications.
